					<h4 class="titlos1">General Information</h4>
					<p class="grammata">Franklin was born in 50 Chepstow Villas, Notting Hill, London, into an affluent and influential British Jewish family. She went to Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex and then she studied Chemistry in Newnham College, Cambridge. Just as her career was peaking, it was cut tragically short when she died of ovarian cancer at age 37. </p>
					<p class="grammata">She was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life, for which Franklin has been variously referred to as: </p>

						<li>the "dark lady of DNA"
						<li>the "forgotten heroine" 
						<li>a "feminist icon"
						<li>the "Sylvia Plath of molecular biology".

					<h4 class="titlos2">Her Research</h4>
					<p class="grammata"> In 1951 Franklin joined the Biophysical Laboratory at King’s College, London, as a research fellow. There she applied X-ray diffraction methods to the study of DNA. When she began her research at King’s College, very little was known about the chemical makeup or structure of DNA. However, she soon discovered the density of DNA and, more importantly, established that the molecule existed in a helical conformation. Her work to make clearer X-ray patterns of DNA molecules laid the foundation for James Watson and Francis Crick to suggest in 1953 that the structure of DNA is a double-helix polymer, a spiral consisting of two DNA strands wound around each other. </p>

					<h4 class="titlos3">Story</h4>
					<p class="grammata"> Unknown to Franklin, Watson and Crick saw some of her unpublished data, including the beautiful "photo 51," shown to Watson by Wilkins. This X-ray diffraction picture of a DNA molecule was Watson's inspiration (the pattern was clearly a helix). Using Franklin's photograph and their own data, Watson and Crick created their famous DNA model.</p><h6>Franklin's contribution was not acknowledged</h6>
